Welcome to NBT's documentation!
===============================

This is a Named Binary Tag parser based upon the specification by Markus Persson.

From The spec:
  "NBT (Named Binary Tag) is a tag based binary format designed to carry large
   amounts of binary data with smaller amounts of additional data.
   An NBT file consists of a single GZIPped Named Tag of type TAG_Compound."

read the full spec at http://www.minecraft.net/docs/NBT.txt

This project also contains helper classes for dealing with Regions and Chunks in
minecraft, the main use case for the NBT format.
